- 👋 Hi, I’m @chelseacox1018
- 👀 I’m interested in edtech and publishing, but I've also repeatedly learned new industries and love that challenge. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to code - I haven't done it since the myspace days
- 💞️ I’m looking to practice and solve problems
- ⚡ Fun fact: I was stung on the toe by a sting ray in Mexico...
